# Multi-Class-Classifier-to-Predict-the-Functional-Impact-of-Cancer-Mutations-on-Protein-Function
Cancer remains a top public health issue and is responsible for millions of deaths annually. One challenge in the advancement of cancer science is understanding how genetic mutations impact the function of proteins and tumor progression. The Project Multi-class Classifier to Predict the Functional Impact of Cancer Mutations utilizes AI to develop a wide-ranging platform to capture genomic, proteomic, and clinical information to classify the pathogenicity of mutations.

The platform incorporates population-scale data from COSMIC, ClinVar, and VEP to normalize mutation data on a common set of parameters. Machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were trained and validated in this dataset, making use of both linear and non-linear relationships. CNNs improved predictive accuracy by targeting complex patterns to identify mutations in an even finer context, while the ensemble learning models provided informative output, interpretability, and stable learning.

A simple-to-use, interactive Streamlit interface allows clinicians to input patient mutation data, visualize the platform's predictions, and create reports that are exportable. The platform incorporates SHAP interpreting techniques for each model so that clinicians can identify the most impactful features on the predictive outcome, such as SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and CADD.

Across multiple evaluations it shows improved accuracy in predictive affect of mutations, and expedites the clinical decision-making process. The platform supports better selection of treatment approaches, improved diagnosis, and improved personalizations in oncology. The study serves as an example of how AI can provide and translate genomic data into actionable clinical insights.
